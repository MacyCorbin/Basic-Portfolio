                        Hello and welcome to my website! I grew up in a small town in the north Georgia called Ellijay. Later, I moved to Atlanta and spent 5 years at Georgia Tech. In 2015, I graduated from the School of Industrial Design at Georgia Institute of Technology.  I am passionate about design and how it improves human interaction with technology. My goal is to be a user experience and user interface designer.

                            In my spare time I improve my programming skills by working on Arduino and Blynk projects. Also, I enjoy outdoor activities and doing nature photography.
